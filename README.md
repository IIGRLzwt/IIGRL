The framework of our proposed Intra-Inter Graph Representation Learning (IIGRL) for protein-protein binding sites
prediction. The upper is intra-graph representation learning, which is designed to improve node/residue representation
within protein graph. The bottom is inter-graph representation learning, exploring to propagate information cross protein
to further enrich node representation.
